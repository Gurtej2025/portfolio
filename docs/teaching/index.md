# Teaching programming to elementary school kids

I started teaching elementary school kids programming concepts in 2021. I realized that at this level they needed simple and easy to undersrtand examples. Also, they responded better to visual programming. I discovered scratch and found it to be an effective tool for teaching programming concepts to kids. 

Below are my projects in order of difficulty level
